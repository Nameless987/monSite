                    I am currently in PCSI license after doing a year of maths-info license because I realized that I was missing physics. <br>
                    I took guitar, judo and climbing lessons when I was younger, I stopped these disciplines because I did not like the format of the lessons.
                    but I still continued climbing which is the sport I enjoy the most.

                <b> Quick Autobiography </b> <br> <br>
                I am a student passionate about physics, maths and computer science and what interests me the most is to understand as much as possible, to find ways of thinking and to share what I understand. <br>
                I started programming at the age of 15 in arduino (which is a microcontroller that uses C / C ++ language)
                as well as in python. <br>
                In final year, I got into C / C ++ (slightly different from arduino) seriously with a very good friend who helped me to progress well in this language.
